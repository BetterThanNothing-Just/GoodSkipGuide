<h3><i>
<p>On the occasion of "Celebration '94" <br>
The public celebrations of the <br>
Royal opening of the Channel Tunnel<br>
by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II <br>
on May 6th 1994</p>

<p>The main C'94 event took place in Folkestone <br>
on Saturday May 7th 1994</p>
</i>

<p>Here is Le Shuttle not crossing the border<br>
Bringing destruction, grief and disorder<br>
Rewards for the rich, bugger all for the poor<br>
Cash down a hole to the country next door</p>

<p>Lap up the lies of the smooth and the sleek<br>
"Services start at the end of the week"<br>
Income projections - a load of tall stories<br>
From Morton and Noulton and other rich Tories</p>

<p>The Queen and her flunkeys come down for the day<br>
Pissing it up and then going away<br>
Leaving the mess and the mud and the muck<br>
For the good folks of Folkestone who don't give a fuck</p>

<p>And what of the people who dug the great hole<br>
Who lost life and limb and got dumped on the dole<br>
The dead and the damaged are all pushed aside<br>
No one's to blame, all rights are denied</p>

<p>Conscience and safety that none will afford<br>
There's money to make and holes to be bored<br>
The claims of the crippled turned down out of hand<br>
Silence the loud with a couple of grand</p>

<p>Stay them with cash or a tight-fisted pension<br>
Securing their silence with threats of suspension<br>
And the PR department still telling the nation<br>
That this is the cause for a big celebration</p>
